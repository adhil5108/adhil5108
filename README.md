# Hey, I'm Hadil 👋

Full-Stack Developer specializing in **Java & Spring Boot**.  
I enjoy building scalable backend systems, designing clean APIs, and solving real-world engineering problems involving data, performance, and system reliability.

Currently building **DataBridge** - a distributed NoSQL → SQL migration engine focused on safe and scalable data transfer (because moving millions of records manually sounded like a bad life decision).

##  Featured Work

I focus on backend-heavy and full-stack systems that demonstrate practical engineering and real-world architecture:

- **DataBridge** — Distributed data migration platform enabling scalable MongoDB → PostgreSQL transfers using event-driven processing.
- **Surplus Food Management System** — Multi-role backend platform with secure APIs, real-time updates, and containerized deployment.
- **E-Commerce REST API** — Modular backend system with JWT authentication, Redis caching, and Dockerized services.
- **Full-Stack Applications** — React interfaces integrated with Spring Boot APIs, emphasizing clean client–server architecture.
